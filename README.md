# Project Overview
This project met the basic requirements and included version control using GitHub/Git. The version control file is located in the 'git' folder.

### Part 1: Refine the Dataset
Data refinement was completed and a new file for subsequent analysis was produced.
The refinement process was automated and could be run with the command python .\main.py.
The code was well-documented with comments in the Jupyter notebook.

### Part 2: Perform Descriptive Analysis of the Dataset
The descriptive analysis was completed as specified.
The Jupyter notebook was provided to re-run the analysis.
The output included textual interpretations for variable values based on guidance documents provided.
